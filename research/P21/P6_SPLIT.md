# P21 / P6 Route B split

Status: **P6 remains Partial.**  This file tracks the preferred smooth-data,
fixed-force Route B from `ASSESSMENT.md` §3.  Closing B0 supplies norm and force
bridges; it does not prove H¹-uniform restart or either endpoint target.

| Unit | Exit condition | Size / model | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| B0 | Reconcile H¹/H² Fourier norms with derivative energy and state shifted-force cap | M / sol | **Closed — lane 503.** Exact identities and finite caps on both domains; targets type-checked in `Targets.lean`. |
| B1 | General (no critical smallness) enstrophy interpolation/Young inequality on R³ | L / astra | Pending |
| B2 | Periodic version including mean and ordinary L² energy | L / astra | Pending |
| B3 | Uniform ODE barrier, integrated dissipation, endpoint monotone limit | M–L / astra | Pending |
| B4 | Maximal-lifespan contradiction, smooth common-interval restriction, regularity and pressure adapters | M / sol | Pending |
| B5 | Uniform restartBeyond and registration/audits | M / sol | Pending |

## B0 output

- `Section4/A04/H1Bridges.lean`: exact whole-space H¹/H² identities and the
  finite compact-window force cap.
- `Section3/T11/H1Bridges.lean`: exact periodic H¹/H² identities, the finite
  cap, and the smooth/periodic package for shifted forces.
- `Targets.lean`: `h1RestartR`, `h1RestartT`, `h1UniformEndpointR`, and
  `h1UniformEndpointT` as unproved `Prop` definitions in registered vocabulary.

## Remaining acceptance risks

- B1/B2 must prove the general cubic enstrophy inequality without importing
  the critical-smallness absorption from T20.
- B3 must choose the barrier time before restart time and datum, retain the
  inhomogeneous low modes, and justify endpoint integrability by monotone
  limits.
- B4 must argue through the already constructed smooth maximal solution; it
  must not infer a lower bound for the selected high-order local horizon.
- On the torus, B3/B4 may use B0's shifted smoothness, periodicity, and common
  `L²` cap, but not shifted membership in `forceClassT`.
- B5 remains responsible for the actual H¹ restart/endpoint theorems and any
  ensuing contract, binding, test, graph, guide, or registry decision.
# P6 Route B split

P6 / L21_H1 remains **Partial**. These are implementation units, not new
article-level closure claims.

| Unit | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| B0 | lane 503 | Norm bridges / force cap; separate worktree, not imported here |
| B1 | lane 504 | Analytic steps closed and kernel-checked; registered-norm inequality conditional only on the exact B0 bridges below |
| B2 | unassigned here | Periodic estimate, including mean |
| B3 | unassigned here | ODE barrier, integrated dissipation, endpoint monotone limit |
| B4 | unassigned here | Maximal-lifespan contradiction and common smooth interval |
| B5 | unassigned here | Uniform restart and final registration |

## B1 handoff

Module: `NSFormalization.Section4.A04.EnstrophyInequality`.
Main theorem: `enstrophy_differential_on_Icc`; pointwise version:
`enstrophy_differential`. For κ=(2π)⁻² and C₀=A05.gradientL6Const,

```
c = 1
Cν = (2κ C₀^(3/2))^4 / (κν/2)^3 / κ^3 + (1+ν) + (1+2κ/ν)
Y(t) = (D01.sobolevENorm 1 (slice w.velocity t)).toReal^2
Z(t) = (D01.sobolevENorm 2 (slice w.velocity t)).toReal^2
Y'(t) + ν Z(t) ≤ Cν (1+Y(t))^3 + Cν l2Sq(slice f t)
```

Exactly three norm hypotheses remain in this theorem, with z=velocity slice:

```lean
-- On all interior times (needed locally for differentiation):
(D01.sobolevENorm 1 z).toReal ^ 2 = l2Sq z + κ * gradientSq z
-- At each time in the chosen closed subinterval:
(D01.sobolevENorm 2 z).toReal ^ 2 ≤
  l2Sq z + 2 * κ * gradientSq z + κ ^ 2 * laplacianSq z
eLpNorm (A05.gradTensor z) 2 volume ≤ ENNReal.ofReal (Real.sqrt (gradientSq z))
```

These are ordinary norm-carrier bridges, not assumed nonlinear or differential
estimates. No B0 module was created. The parameterized theorem
`enstrophy_differential_of_norm_bridges` allows any fixed 0<κ≤1 if reconciliation
requires a different convention. The fixed κ matches the current Fourier weight
`(1+|ξ|²)^(s/2)` and the 2π derivative convention.

The independent `convection_sobolev` theorem consumes the two explicit bounds
`eLpNorm gradTensor 2 ≤ ofReal (2π * H1)` and
`eLpNorm lap 2 ≤ ofReal ((2π)^2 * H2)`, with Hm the finite real Sobolev norm.
Its underlying physical estimate `convection_interpolation` is unconditional.

No initial-time derivative or endpoint time integral is asserted. Compact
intervals lie strictly inside (0,T). B3 must still perform the uniform barrier
and endpoint limit; strict-interior finiteness alone does not suffice.
